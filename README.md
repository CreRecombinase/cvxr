# CVXR

An R modeling language for convex optimization problems.

## Note

This package is still under active development. You can install it, but crucial glue to the Canon interface which bridges any language---in our case R---and C-level libraries still requires work to do anything useful.

## Installation

You may experiment with the DSL expressing problems using the current version by installing it. We are unable to provide any support until the package is officially released.
